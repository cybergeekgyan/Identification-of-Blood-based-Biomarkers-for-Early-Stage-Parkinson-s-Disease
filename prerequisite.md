## Overview of Basic Biology Concepts. 

you should be familiar with:

1. the central dogma

2. how genes are transcribed

3. how mRNA is translated to proteins

4. how microarrays work for gene expression profiling



Here are resources to review if you do not know the above topics. All credit is to the creators of these resources.

[What is the central dogma?](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-the-central-dogma#:~:text=The%20'Central%20Dogma'%20is%20the,of%20the%20structure%20of%20DNA.)

**NOTE** --- If you have taken a high school biology course or AP Biology, you probably only need to read the articles about DNA microarrays.
